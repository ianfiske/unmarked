abstract = {Models for the analysis of longitudinal data must recognize the relationship between serial observations on the same unit. Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

abstract = {Abstract  This article review methodologies used for analyzing ordered categorical (ordinal) response variables. We begin by surveying
models for data with a single ordinal response variable. We also survey recently proposed strategies for modeling ordinal
response variables when the data have some type of clustering or when repeated measurement occurs at various occasions for
each subject, such as in longitudinal studies. Primary models in that case includemarginal models andcluster-specific (conditional) models for which effects apply conditionally at the cluster level. Related discussion refers to multi-level and transitional models.
The main emphasis is on maximum likelihood inference, although we indicate certain models (e.g., marginal models, multi-level
models) for which this can be computationally difficult. The Bayesian approach has also received considerable attention for
categorical data in the past decade, and we survey recent Bayesian approaches to modeling ordinal response variables. Alternative,
non-model-based, approaches are also available for certain types of inference.},

@article{Neal2003,
abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can ample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under
the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant.  Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

Amphibians are more threatened and are declining more rapidly than either birds or mammals. Although many declines are due to habitat loss and overutilization, other, unidentified processes threaten 48\% of rapidly declining species and are driving species most quickly to extinction. Declines are nonrandom in terms of species' ecological preferences, geographic ranges, and taxonomic associations and are most prevalent among Neotropical montane, stream-associated species. The lack of conservation remedies for these poorly understood declines means that hundreds of amphibian species now face extinction.},

This procedure resembles the best linear unbiased procedure of Henderson (1975, Biometrics 31, 423-447) for predicting the value of a quantitative response. The approach is based on a mixed-model version of the threshold model in which it is assumed that the observed category is determined by the value of an underlying unobservable continuous response that follows a mixed linear model. The results are illustrated by an application to the problem of predicting the degree of difficulty that will be experienced by a dairy cow in the birth of her calf.},

@article{Banerjee2008a,
abstract = {Summary. With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.},

In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with \$J > 2\$ categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.},

This model is developed for both the probit and logistic response functions. The threshold concept is used, in which it is assumed that the observed ordered category is determined by the value of a latent unobservable continuous response that follows a linear regression model incorporating random effects. A maximum marginal likelihood (MML) solution is described using Gauss-Hermite quadrature to numerically integrate over the distribution of random effects. An analysis of a dataset where students are clustered or nested within classrooms is used to illustrate features of random-effects analysis of clustered ordinal data, while an analysis of a longitudinal dataset where psychiatric patients are repeatedly rated as to their severity is used to illustrate features of the random-effects approach for longitudinal ordinal data.},

This kind of model is particularly appealing in situations where the effect of one or more explanatory processes on the response present substantial heterogeneity in both dimensions. We describe how to perform inference for this class of models and also how to perform forecasting in time and interpolation in space, using simulation techniques. The performance of the algorithm to estimate the parameters of the model and to perform prediction in time is investigated with simulated data sets.

@article{Reich2009a,
abstract = {Summary. Physical activity has many well-documented health benefits for cardiovascular fitness and weight control. For pregnant women, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists currently recommends 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days; however, very few pregnant women achieve this level of activity. Traditionally, studies have focused on examining individual or interpersonal factors to identify predictors of physical activity. There is a renewed interest in whether characteristics of the physical environment in which we live and work may also influence physical activity levels. We consider one of the first studies of pregnant women that examines the impact of characteristics of the built environment on physical activity levels. Using a socioecologic framework, we study the associations between physical activity and several factors including personal characteristics, meteorological/air quality variables, and neighborhood characteristics for pregnant women in four counties of North Carolina. We simultaneously analyze six types of physical activity and investigate cross-dependencies between these activity types. Exploratory analysis suggests that the associations are different in different regions. Therefore, we use a multivariate regression model with spatially varying regression coefficients. This model includes a regression parameter for each covariate at each spatial location. For our data with many predictors, some form of dimension reduction is clearly needed. We introduce a Bayesian variable selection procedure to identify subsets of important variables. Our stochastic search algorithm determines the probabilities that each covariate's effect is null, non-null but constant across space, and spatially varying. We found that individual-level covariates had a greater influence on women's activity levels than neighborhood environmental characteristics, and some individual-level covariates had spatially varying associations with the activity levels of pregnant women.},

@article{Kneib2006,
abstract = {Motivated by a space-time study on forest health with damage state of trees as the response, we propose a general class of structured additive regression models for categorical responses, allowing for a flexible semiparametric predictor. Nonlinear effects of continuous covariates, time trends, and interactions between continuous covariates are modeled by penalized splines. Spatial effects can be estimated based on Markov random fields, Gaussian random fields, or two-dimensional penalized splines. We present our approach from a Bayesian perspective, with inference based on a categorical linear mixed model representation. The resulting empirical Bayes method is closely related to penalized likelihood estimation in a frequentist setting. Variance components, corresponding to inverse smoothing parameters, are estimated using (approximate) restricted maximum likelihood. In simulation studies we investigate the performance of different choices for the spatial effect, compare the empirical Bayes approach to competing methodology, and study the bias of mixed model estimates. As an application we analyze data from the forest health survey.},

@article{Tutz2003,
abstract = {Semiparametrically structured models are defined as a class of models for which the predictors may contain parametric parts, additive parts of covariates with an unspecified functional form, and interactions which are described as varying coefficients. In the case of an ordinal response the complexity of the predictor is determined by different sorts of effects. Global effects and category-specific effects are distinguished; the latter allow the effect to vary across response categories. A general framework is developed in which global as well as category-specific effects may have unspecified functional form. The framework extends various existing methods of modeling ordinal responses. The Wilkinson-Rogers notation is extended to incorporate smooth model parts and varying coefficient terms, the latter being important for the smooth specification of category-specific effects.},
