The following is just a summary.


Version 0.10-4

  o Added importFrom("plyr", "ldply") to NAMESPACE because "reshape" no longer 
    depends on "plyr" 


Version 0.10-3

  o RcppArmadillo was moved from "Depends" section of DESCRIPTION file to 	
    "LinkingTo"


Version 0.10-2

  Bug fixes

  o Thanks for Dirk Eddelbuettel for patch to deal with change in Armadillo's 
    in-place reshape function. Serious problems might occur if you use a recent 
    version of RcppArmadillo and an old version of unmarked.

  o Dave Miller added another NA handling fix in occuFP(). I forgot to add 
    this one in the previous version. 


Version 0.10-1
