Version 0.11-0

  o Andy Royle is the new maintainer  

  o Added Rebecca Hutchinson's penalized likelihood function occuPEN
    (experimental) 

  o fixed bug in gmultmix to accommodate mixed sampling protocols (NA
    in count frequency vector is not counted in the constraint that
    multinomial cell probabilities sum to 1)  

  o Changed variable 'ufp' to 'ufc' in ovenbird data and related functions.

  o Removed constraint in pcountOpen that lambdaformula==omegaformula 

  o Fixed bug in gdistsamp that caused error when NAs were present in
    half-normal model  

  o Fixed bug in ranef (it was giving an error message for pcountOpen with the 
    new dynamics options (Ricker and Gompertz) and working incorrectly for
    pcountOpen with immigration)

  o Fixed bug in pcountOpen that occurred when covariates were time
    varying but not varying among sites 


Version 0.10-6

  o Fixed bug in C++ code that was causing problems on Solaris 


Version 0.10-5

  o Added new models of population dynamics to pcountOpen. Most
    changes contributed by Jeff Hostetler.  


Version 0.10-4

  o Added importFrom("plyr", "ldply") to NAMESPACE because "reshape" no longer
    depends on "plyr"


Version 0.10-3

  o RcppArmadillo was moved from "Depends" section of DESCRIPTION file to
    "LinkingTo"


Version 0.10-2

  Bug fixes

  o Thanks for Dirk Eddelbuettel for patch to deal with change in Armadillo's
    in-place reshape function. Serious problems might occur if you use a recent
    version of RcppArmadillo and an old version of unmarked.

  o Dave Miller added another NA handling fix in occuFP(). I forgot to add
    this one in the previous version.


Version 0.10-1

  o Doc fixes requested by CRAN


Version 0.10-0

  Bug fixes

  o  Fixed NA handling in occuFP()

  o  Fixed integration setting in C++ code that were causing segfaults
     when calling distsamp

  o  Replace raster:::layerNames() with raster:::names()


  New features

  o  distsamp() and gdistsamp() should be faster and more stable for
     some keyfun/survey combinations



Version 0.12-0
